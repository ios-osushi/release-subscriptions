This **significantly improves animation performance** while also eliminating CPU overhead.\r\n  * The Core Animation rendering engine is currently **opt-in**, configured by a feature flag ([`LottieConfiguration.renderingEngine`](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/blob/master/Sources/Public/LottieConfiguration.swift#L22)). In a future major version of Lottie, we plan on enabling the new rendering engine by default.\r\n  * Due to limitations of Core Animation, not all Lottie animation features are supported by the new rendering engine. Lottie includes a [`RenderingEngineOption.automatic`](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/blob/master/Sources/Public/LottieConfiguration.swift#L35) option, which detects if an animation can be played correctly using the new rendering engine and otherwise falls back to the legacy main thread rendering engine:\r\n  \r\n    ```swift\r\n    // Can be enabled globally:\r\n    //  - Use the Core Animation rendering engine if possible,\r\n    //    otherwise fall back to using the Main Thread rendering engine\r\n    LottieConfiguration.shared.renderingEngine = .automatic\r\n\r\n    // Or when initializing your Animation View:\r\n    let animationView = AnimationView(\r\n      animation: ...,\r\n      configuration: LottieConfiguration(renderingEngine: .automatic))\r\n    ```\r\n  * If you encounter any compatibility issues when using RenderingEngineOption.automatic, please file an issue with a copy of your animation json.\r\n\r\n* [Added new dictionary-based Animation decoding implementation (#1561)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1561)\r\n  * 2x faster than the existing `Codable` decoding implementation\r\n  * There may be some compatibility issues with this implementation, so it is currently opt-in, configured by a feature flag ([`LottieConfiguration.decodingStrategy`](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/blob/master/Sources/Public/LottieConfiguration.swift#L25)):\r\n\r\n    ```swift\r\n    // Can be enabled globally:\r\n    LottieConfiguration.shared.decodingStrategy = .dictionaryBased\r\n        \r\n    // Or when initializing your Animation View:\r\n    let animationView = AnimationView(\r\n      animation: ...,\r\n      configuration: LottieConfiguration(decodingStrategy: .dictionaryBased))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  * If you encounter any compatibility issues with this new decoding implementation, please file an issue with a copy of your animation json.\r\n* [Added blend mode support (#1585)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1585)\r\n* [Added `LottieLogger` type that allows for customizing how Lottie outputs log messages (#1474)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1474)\r\n* [Add keyframe animation support to `ValueProviders` API (#1491)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1491)\r\n* [Added support for loading images stored in Asset Catalogs (#1511)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1511)\r\n* [Added support for accessing the original value of an AnimationKeypath (#1559)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1559)\r\n* [Added support for loading animations with “.json” file extension in name (#1561)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1561)\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* [Improved performance of Gradient Fill layers (#1558)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1558)\r\n* [Fixed Carthage support (#1496)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1496)\r\n* [Avoid automatic animations for rapid opacity changes (#1397)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1397)\r\n* [Fixed GroupNode empty transform issue (#1372)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1510)\r\n* [Fixed nil host warning when data url is base64 encoded (#1524)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1524)\r\n* [Fixed issue where frame parameter was ignored in `AnimationView.init(frame:)` initializer (#1527)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1527)\r\n* [Fixed issue with Polygon rendering (#1537)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1537)\r\n* [Fixed issue where `layer(for: keypath)` could unexpectedly return nil (#1587)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1587)\r\n* [Improved performance of `BundleImageProvider` by caching images (#1590)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1590)\r\n* [Improved performance of `InvertedMatteLayer` (#1388)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1388)",

These `typealias`es are marked as deprecated and include fix-its to update call-sites to the new name.\r\n\r\n### Lottie 4.0\r\n\r\nWe plan on releasing **Lottie 4.0** in the next few weeks. In Lottie 4.0 we will remove the compatibility typealiases (for `Animation`, `AnimationView`, `Color`, etc) , so code using the old names will no longer compile. This will resolve the naming conflicts with SwiftUI types. Consider updating to Lottie 3.5.0 first, applying the fix-its recommended by the deprecation warnings, and then update to Lottie 4.0 once it is released (Lottie 4.0 will no longer include deprecation warnings with fix-its). Thank you for bearing with us through this transition process!\r\n\r\nLottie 4.0 will also make the new Core Animation rendering engine ([added in Lottie 3.4.0](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/discussions/1627)) the default rendering engine option. As mentioned above, please try out the new rendering engine if you haven't yet and let us know if you encounter any issues! We've been hard at work fixing issues reported by the community.",

Animations that use features which are not supported by the Core Animation rendering engine will automatically fall back to using the original Main Thread rendering engine.\r\n  * When using the Core Animation rendering engine, Lottie animations now always animate smoothly regardless of the amount of work being done on the app’s main thread. This **significantly improves animation performance** while also eliminating CPU overhead.\r\n  * If you encounter any compatibility issues when using `RenderingEngineOption.automatic`, please file an issue with a copy of your animation json.\r\n\r\n* `DecodingStrategy.dictionaryBased` is now enabled by default\r\n  * The new dictionary-based decoding implementation is 2x faster than the previous `Codable` decoding implementation\r\n  * If you encounter any compatibility issues with this new decoding implementation, please file an issue with a copy of your animation json.\r\n* Backwards compatibility typealiases for `Animation`, `AnimationView`, `Color`, `Vector1D`, `Vector2D`, and `Vector3D`, which were introduced in [Lottie 3.5.0](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/releases), have been removed to resolve conflicts with types in Apple frameworks.

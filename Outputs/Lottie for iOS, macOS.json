    "body" : "### New features\r\n\r\n* Added a **new animation rendering engine** powered by **Core Animation** ([lean more](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/discussions/1627))\r\n  * When using the new rendering engine, Lottie animations now always smoothly regardless of the amount of work being done on the app’s main thread. This **significantly improves animation performance** while also eliminating CPU overhead.\r\n  * The Core Animation rendering engine is currently **opt-in**, configured by a feature flag ([`LottieConfiguration.renderingEngine`](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/blob/master/Sources/Public/LottieConfiguration.swift#L22)). In a future major version of Lottie, we plan on enabling the new rendering engine by default.\r\n  * Due to limitations of Core Animation, not all Lottie animation features are supported by the new rendering engine. Lottie includes a [`RenderingEngineOption.automatic`](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/blob/master/Sources/Public/LottieConfiguration.swift#L35) option, which detects if an animation can be played correctly using the new rendering engine and otherwise falls back to the legacy main thread rendering engine:\r\n  \r\n    ```swift\r\n    // Can be enabled globally:\r\n    //  - Use the Core Animation rendering engine if possible,\r\n    //    otherwise fall back to using the Main Thread rendering engine\r\n    LottieConfiguration.shared.renderingEngine = .automatic\r\n\r\n    // Or when initializing your Animation View:\r\n    let animationView = AnimationView(\r\n      animation: ...,\r\n      configuration: LottieConfiguration(renderingEngine: .automatic))\r\n    ```\r\n  * If you encounter any compatibility issues when using RenderingEngineOption.automatic, please file an issue with a copy of your animation json.\r\n\r\n* [Added new dictionary-based Animation decoding implementation (#1561)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1561)\r\n  * 2x faster than the existing `Codable` decoding implementation\r\n  * There may be some compatibility issues with this implementation, so it is currently opt-in, configured by a feature flag ([`LottieConfiguration.decodingStrategy`](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/blob/master/Sources/Public/LottieConfiguration.swift#L25)):\r\n\r\n    ```swift\r\n    // Can be enabled globally:\r\n    LottieConfiguration.shared.decodingStrategy = .dictionaryBased\r\n        \r\n    // Or when initializing your Animation View:\r\n    let animationView = AnimationView(\r\n      animation: ...,\r\n      configuration: LottieConfiguration(decodingStrategy: .dictionaryBased))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  * If you encounter any compatibility issues with this new decoding implementation, please file an issue with a copy of your animation json.\r\n* [Added blend mode support (#1585)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1585)\r\n* [Added `LottieLogger` type that allows for customizing how Lottie outputs log messages (#1474)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1474)\r\n* [Add keyframe animation support to `ValueProviders` API (#1491)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1491)\r\n* [Added support for loading images stored in Asset Catalogs (#1511)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1511)\r\n* [Added support for accessing the original value of an AnimationKeypath (#1559)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1559)\r\n* [Added support for loading animations with “.json” file extension in name (#1561)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1561)\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* [Improved performance of Gradient Fill layers (#1558)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1558)\r\n* [Fixed Carthage support (#1496)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1496)\r\n* [Avoid automatic animations for rapid opacity changes (#1397)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1397)\r\n* [Fixed GroupNode empty transform issue (#1372)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1510)\r\n* [Fixed nil host warning when data url is base64 encoded (#1524)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1524)\r\n* [Fixed issue where frame parameter was ignored in `AnimationView.init(frame:)` initializer (#1527)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1527)\r\n* [Fixed issue with Polygon rendering (#1537)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1537)\r\n* [Fixed issue where `layer(for: keypath)` could unexpectedly return nil (#1587)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1587)\r\n* [Improved performance of `BundleImageProvider` by caching images (#1590)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1590)\r\n* [Improved performance of `InvertedMatteLayer` (#1388)](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/pull/1388)",

    "body" : "This release prepares for source stability by deprecating some OrderedDictionary APIs that we'd like to remove in version 1.0 of the package. (All deprecated names have reasonable replacements.)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- The two `OrderedDictionary.modifyValue` methods were renamed `updateValue`, to better align with the standard `updateValue` function (#90)\r\n    ```swift\r\n    /* Old: */ d.modifyValue(forKey: key,  default: []) { $0.append(newValue) }\r\n    /* New: */ d.updateValue(forKey: key,  default: []) { $0.append(newValue) }\r\n\r\n    /* Old: */ d.modifyValue(forKey: key,  insertingDefault: [], at: 0) { $0.append(newValue) }\r\n    /* New: */ d.updateValue(forKey: key,  insertingDefault: [], at: 0) { $0.append(newValue) }\r\n    ```\r\n- `OrderedDictionary.subscript(offset:)` was removed; it used inconsistent terminology. To access a key-value pair at a given position, you can continue using the unlabeled subscript on the `elements` view.\r\n\r\n    ```swift\r\n    /*  Deprecated: */ d[offset: 42]\r\n    /* Replacement: */ d.element[42]\r\n    ```\r\n- The collections benchmarks were moved to a standalone nested package in a subdirectory of the repository, allowing the top-level package manifest to stop declaring a dependency on [swift-collections-benchmark](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark). This will make it easier to add Swift Collections as a dependency, especially in projects such as the Package Manager (or the benchmarking tool itself).\r\n\r\nThe old names for removed/renamed APIs are still available as deprecated members -- these will be removed in the 1.0 release. \r\n\r\n### Pull requests\r\n\r\n- #81 Fix typos: missing subscript parameters (by @ejmarchant)\r\n- #82 Fix documentation for types conforming to ExpressibleByArrayLiteral or ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral (by @ejmarchant)\r\n- #86 Stop depending on swift-collections-benchmark (by @lorentey)\r\n- #91 [OrderedDictionary] modifyValue → updateValue (by @lorentey)\r\n- #93 Add Benchmarks package to workspace (by @lorentey)\r\n- #92 [OrderedDictionary] Deprecate `subscript(offset:)` for now (by @lorentey)\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this release!

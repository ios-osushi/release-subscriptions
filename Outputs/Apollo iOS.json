We've decided to revert to the more stable Starscream version 3. In order to fix a few known bugs in Starscream 3, we have made a fork of Starscream that Apollo will depend on going forward. In preparation for moving to Apple WebSockets in the future, we have also fully inverted the dependency on Starscream. Between these two changes, a lot of breaking changes to our Web Socket API have been made:\r\n  - The `ApolloWebSocketClient` protocol was removed and replaced with `WebSocketClient`.\r\n  - `WebSocketClient` does not rely directly on Starscream anymore and has been streamlined for easier conformance.\r\n  - `ApolloWebSocket`, the default implementation of the `WebSocketClient` has been replaced with `DefaultWebSocket`. This implementation uses Starscream, but implementations using other websocket libraries can now be created and used with no need for Starscream.\r\n  - `WebSocketClientDelegate` replaces direct dependency on `Starscream.WebSocketDelegate` for delegates.\r\n- **Breaking:** Renamed some of the request chain interceptors object:\r\n  - `LegacyInterceptorProvider` -> `DefaultInterceptorProvider`\r\n  - `LegacyCacheReadInterceptor` -> `CacheReadInterceptor`\r\n  - `LegacyCacheWriteInterceptor` -> `CacheWriteInterceptor`\r\n  - `LegacyParsingInterceptor` -> `JSONResponseParsingInterceptor`\r\n- **Breaking:** `WebSocketTransport` is now initialized with an `ApolloWebSocket` (or other object conforming to the `ApolloWebSocketClient` protocol.) Previously, the initializer took in the necessary parameters to create the web socket internally. This provides better dependency injection capabilities and makes testing easier.\r\n- Removed class constraint on `ApolloInterceptor` and converted to structs for all interceptors that could be structs instead of classes.\r\n- Added `removeRecords(matching pattern: CacheKey)` function to the normalized cache.",

    "body" : "This is the first Alpha Release of Apollo iOS 1.0. This first major version will include a new code generation engine, better generated models, and many syntax and performance improvements across the entire library. The primary goal of Apollo iOS 1.0 is to stabilize the API of the model layer and provide a foundation for future feature additions and evolution of the library.\r\n\r\n## What’s New\r\n\r\n* The size of generated code has been reduced dramatically. In the most complex operations, the generated code can be up to **90% smaller** than in the previous version.\r\n* Generated response objects are more powerful and easier to consume.\r\n    * The response objects now intelligently merge fields from not only their parents, but also other matching sibling fragments.\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery AnimalQuery {\r\n  allAnimals {\r\n    species\r\n    ... on Pet {\r\n      name\r\n    }\r\n    ... on Cat {\r\n      furColor\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the past, the `AsCat` model would have fields for `species`, and `furColor`, but to access the `name` field, you would need to keep a reference to the `AllAnimal` object and call `AsPet.name`. This means that you couldn’t just pass the `AsCat` object to a UI component. \r\n\r\nIn 1.0, because we know that `Cat` implements the `Pet` interface, the `name` field is merged into the `Cat` object. \r\n\r\n*Any property that should exist based on the type of the object will be accessible.* This makes consuming our generated response objects in your applications much easier. This should greatly reduce the need for view models to wrap our generated response objects.\r\n\r\n* The code generation engine is now written in native Swift! This makes it easier for Swift developers to contribute to the project or alter the generated code for their specific needs! In future iterations, we hope to open up the code generation templating API to allow for even easier customization of your generated code!\r\n* Computation of Cache Keys is protocol oriented now. Instead of a single `cacheKeyForObject` closure on your `ApolloClient`, you can implement cache key computation on individual object types with the `CacheKeyProvider` protocol. See [Cache Key Resolution](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/blob/release/1.0-alpha-incubating/CodegenProposal.md#cache-key-resolution) in the RFC for more information.\r\n\r\n## What’s Next - (Things Not Supported in Alpha 1)\r\n\r\n* **Operation Variables and Field Arguments**\r\n* **@include/@skip Directives**\r\n* **Cocoapods and Carthage Support for Generated Objects**\r\n    * Currently, the generated code supports creating an SPM package you can include as a target in your `Package.swift` file. Cocoapods and Carthage support will be coming soon.\r\n    * In the mean time, you can still generate your operations and manually include the generated code in your project.\r\n* **Automatically Persisted Queries**\r\n* **Cache Mutations**\r\n    * We are re-writing the entire cache mutation system to be easier to work with. Instead of exposing the cache via the operations you have defined, you’ll be able to access the cache through custom generated types that have a view of the entire cache at once. *This means no more writing query operations that are only used for local cache mutations.\r\n\r\n## Feedback we are looking for\r\n\r\nWhile any and all feedback about the API design, structure, and usability of the library is appreciated, this Alpha version version focuses on the new generated operation models. We would love to hear about your experiences with:\r\n\r\n* Generating your models using the SwiftScripts method\r\n* Consuming the new generated models in your application code\r\n    * Are there any use cases that were supported in the previous versions that are not supported or regress in the Alpha? (Other than the known cases listed above that will be supported soon.)\r\n    * Do the new generated models make working with your data easier or more difficult?\r\n    * Do you have specific suggestions for things that can be added or altered in the generated objects to make them more useful?\r\n\r\n## Expected Alpha Roadmap\r\n\r\n* **Operation Variables and Field Arguments**\r\n    * ASAP - Planned for next Alpha release within a week or two.\r\n* **@include/@skip Directives**\r\n    * Next priority after variables and arguments. Maybe the same release, maybe the next release after that\r\n* **Cocoapods and Carthage Support for Generated Objects**\r\n    * Probably a little while out, but shouldn’t be too hard. So maybe after the two above this.\r\n* **Automatically Persisted Queries**\r\n    * This is mostly done, just need to actually figure out how to compute the operation identifier hash and generate the operationIds.json file. This is lower priority though, since not a ton of people use it.\r\n* **Cache Mutations**\r\n    * This is going to take a long time still. We won’t move into Beta until we have the solution for this ready to test, but it’s only about 70% solved so far, and the implementation is not written yet. \r\n    * I’m considering exposing an API to mutate the cache just using the stringly-typed dictionary of data in the mean time, to unblock people from trying out the Alpha in their applications while we solve this. This would be unsafe and not great for production, but should work just fine and be quick and easy to implement as a stop-gap.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCurrently, only SPM is fully supported. Because the generated models can’t easily be consumed by a Cocoapods project yet, we have not included support for installation of the client with Cocoapods. This will be included in an upcoming release shortly.\r\n\r\n## SPM\r\n\r\n```\r\n.package(name: \"Apollo\",\r\n         url: \"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios.git\", \r\n         from: \"1.0.0-alpha.1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun codegen using the instructions from the [Swift scripting documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/v1.0-(Alpha)/swift-scripting/).\r\n",

[#2147](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/2147) - _Thank you to [Tiziano Coroneo](https://github.com/TizianoCoroneo) for the contribution._\r\n- **Fixed - [Watcher using a policy that shouldn't hit the network, can still hit the network](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/2170):** If the cache policy given to the `watch(query:cachePolicy:)` method of `ApolloClient` was `.returnCacheDataDontFetch` it could still trigger a remote fetch of the query. - _Thank you to [Peter Potrebic](https://github.com/potrebic) for raising the issue._\r\n- **BREAKING CHANGE - [`graphql-ws` Protocol Support](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/1622):** We've added official support for the [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) library and its [`graphql-transport-ws`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol. This is a breaking change because the `WebSocket` initializers now require you to specify which protocol to use.",

The Beta does not have complete documentation or usage guides, which will be completed prior to GA.\r\n\r\nThis first major version will include a new code generation engine, better generated models, and many syntax and performance improvements across the entire library. The primary goal of Apollo iOS 1.0 is to stabilize the API of the model layer and provide a foundation for future feature additions and evolution of the library.\r\n\r\n- **Breaking: Changed API for Cache Key Configuration:** Cache Key Resolution is now easier to configure. See `CacheKeyInfo` for examples and documentation.\r\n- **Breaking: Changed API for generated Schema Types to support dynamic types** The API for generated schema types now initializes instances of `Object`, `Interface`, and `Union` for each corresponding type in your schema. These are still generated by the code generation engine. This differs from the previous API which generated static types that were subclasses of `Object`, `Interface`, and `Union`. The change provides the API to support the future addition of dynamic types added to your schema at runtime.\r\n- **New: Codegen CLI will now automatically create output directories:** You no longer are required to have already created all intermediary directories for your codegen output paths prior to running code generation. \r\n- **New: CodegenCLI is built locally with CocoaPods installations:** This is to ensure that the version of the Codegen CLI is the same as ApolloCodegenLib. This behavior will be extended to Swift Package Manager installations too.\r\n- **New: Swift Keywords are escaped when used as names of fields or types in generated objects:** Previously, using Swift keywords (eg. `self`, `protocol`, `Type`) as the names of fields in your operations or types in your schema would cause compilation errors in your generated code. Now, these names will be escaped with backticks to prevent compiler errors. **The names `__data` and `fragments` cannot be used as field names as they conflict with Apollo's generated object APIs** Using these names will result in a validation error being thrown when attempting to run the code generation engine.\r\n- **Fixed: Fragments with lowercase names caused compilation errors:** This bug is fixed. Fragments with lowercase names will be correctly uppercased when referencing the generated `Fragment` objects. \r\n- **Fixed: Build errors in Xcode 14/Swift 5.7:** The library was updated to support the Swift 5.7 language version. Swift 5.6 is still supported. \r\n- **Fixed: Xcode 14 does not support Bitcode:** Starting with Xcode 14, bitcode is no longer required for watchOS and tvOS applications, and the App Store no longer accepts bitcode submissions from Xcode 14.  \r\n- **Fixed: \"No such module `ApolloAPI`\" error when using CocoaPods:** The podspec was not configured to import all required source files and some import statements were unnecessary in a CocoaPods environment. A code generation configuration option was added to order to ensure generated files are generated with the correct import statements in a CocoaPods environment. **When generating code for a project that includes `Apollo` via Cocoapods, you must set the `cocoapodsCompatibleImportStatements` option to `true` in your `ApolloCodegenConfiguration`.** When using the Codegen CLI that is built for you during `pod install` the `apollo-ios-cli init` command will default this option to `true`. When building the Codegen CLI in by other method, this option will default to `false`.  \r\n- **Removed: ApolloUtils target no longer necessary:** The things that used to be shared here are actually no longer shared. There is no code shared between the `Apollo` and `ApolloCodegenLib` targets.  \r\n- **Removed: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.validation:** This method was incorrectly requiring destination paths to exist before code generation. Once that was removed it was no longer necessary. Any errors that are encountered with destination output paths will be raised during code generation.",

Some breaking changes may occur due to user feedback prior to General Availability (GA) Release. The Beta does not have complete documentation or usage guides, which will be completed prior to GA.\r\n\r\nThis first major version will include a new code generation engine, better generated models, and many syntax and performance improvements across the entire library. The primary goal of Apollo iOS 1.0 is to stabilize the API of the model layer and provide a foundation for future feature additions and evolution of the library.\r\n\r\n* **Breaking: Generated Files now have the file extension `.graphql.swift`.**\r\n  * This allows you to clearly distinguish which files in your project are Apollo generated files.\r\n  * Generated template files that are user-editable will still have the `.swift` file extension. \r\n    * `CustomScalar` templates as well as the `SchemaConfiguration` file are user-editable. Once these are generated, they are never overwritten by future code generation execution.\r\n  * This change is also necessary for the identification of generated files for the pruning functionality.\r\n* **New: Pruning of Unused Generated Files**\r\n  * Generated files that no longer should exist are automatically deleted now. This occurs when a `.graphql` file is removed from your project. The generated file will also be deleted the next time code generation is run.\r\n  * This can be disabled with the new `pruneGeneratedFiles` codegen option.\r\n  * **Breaking: Automatic Deletion will not delete files generated in previous Alpha/Beta versions.**\r\n    * Only files with the `.graphql.swift` file extension will be deleted.\r\n    * If you have used previous Alpha/Beta versions, you will need to delete your generated files manually one last time before running code generation with this version.\r\n* **New: Enum Case Names are Converted to Camel Case in Generated Enums.** \r\n  * **Breaking: This is enabled by default, your call sites will need to be updated.**\r\n  * Camel case conversion for enum cases can be disabled with the new `conversionStrategies.enumCases` codegen option.\r\n  * Thanks [@bannzai](https://github.com/bannzai) for this one!\r\n* **Fixed: Swift Keywords are escaped when used as names of Enum Values** Thanks [@bannzai](https://github.com/bannzai) for the fix!\r\n* **Fixed: Compilation Error when Using Fragment with Lowercased Name** This was an edge case that only occured when referencing a nested, merged selection set from the lowercase named fragment.\r\n* **Fixed: Retain Cycle in `ReadTransaction`** Thanks [@lorraine-hatch](https://github.com/lorraine-hatch) for the fix!\r\n* **Fixed: String `jsonValue` Initializer for Large Numbers** Thanks [@Almaz5200](https://github.com/Almaz5200) for the fix!",

    "body" : "This is the first Release Candidate for Apollo iOS 1.0. The Release Candidate is a fully featured and code-complete representation of the final 1.0 version. This includes full feature parity with the 0.x.x releases.\r\n\r\nAPI breaking changes are not expected between the Release Candidate and the General Availability (GA) release. The only code changes will be non-breaking bug fixes due to user feedback. The Release Candidate does not have complete documentation or usage guides, which will be completed prior to GA.\r\n\r\nThis first major version will include a new code generation engine, better generated models, and many syntax and performance improvements across the entire library. The primary goal of Apollo iOS 1.0 is to stabilize the API of the model layer and provide a foundation for future feature additions and evolution of the library.\r\n\r\n* **New: Option to Include Deprecated Input Arguments on Fields During Schema Download** Thanks to [@dave-perry](https://github.com/dave-perry) for this addition!\r\n* **Fixed: Code Generation Config JSON File Compatibility** \r\n  * Previously, the `apollo-codegen-config.json` file used by the Apollo CLI needed to contain values for all optional fields. When new codegen options were added, this would cause errors until all newly added options has values provided. \r\n  * The `Codable` implementation for the `ApolloCodgenConfiguration` has been implemented manually to prevent this. Now, only required fields must be provided, all optional fields can be omitted from the config file safely. \r\n  * The CLI's `init` command also now generates a template config file with only the required fields.\r\n* **Fixed: Swift Keywords are escaped when used as names of Input Parameters**\r\n* **Fixed: Compilation Error when using `@skip` and `@include` conditions on the same field**\r\n* **Fixed: Added permissions request to SPM Code Generation Plugin**\r\n  * When running the code generation plugin, you will be prompted to give permission for the plugin to write to the package directory.\r\n  * This permission check can be avoided by passing the `--allow-writing-to-package-directory` flag when executing the plugin command.\r\n* **Fixed: APQ Operations Will no Longer be Retried when Unrecognized if using `.persistedOperationsOnly`**\r\n  * `.persistedOperationsOnly` is for use with allow-listed operations only. If an operation identifier is not recognized by the server, there is no way to register the operation in this configuration.   \r\n* **Breaking: Updated `ApolloAPI` internal metadata properties to be `__` prefixed.**\r\n  * Generated GraphQL files expose certain properties/functions that are consumed by the `Apollo` library during GraphQL Execution. These members must be public in order to be exposed to `Apollo`, but are not intended for external consumption. We have added underscore prefixes to each of these members to signify that intention, using `__` for GraphQL Metadata (in alignment with the GraphQL Specification) and `_` for `Apollo`'s utility and helper functions.\r\n  * The affected signatures are:\r\n    * `SelectionSet.schema` -> `SelectionSet.__schema`\r\n    * `SelectionSet.selection` -> `SelectionSet.__selection`\r\n    * `JSONEncodable.jsonValue` -> `JSONEncodable._jsonValue`\r\n    * `JSONDecodable.init(jsonValue:)` -> `JSONDecodable.init(_jsonValue:)`\r\n    * `AnyHashableConvertible.asAnyHashable` -> `AnyHashableConvertible._asAnyHashable`\r\n    * `OutputTypeConvertible.asOutputType` -> `OutputTypeConvertible._asOutputType`\r\n    * `GraphQLOperation.variables` -> `GraphQLOperation._variables`\r\n    * `LocalCacheMutation.variables` -> `LocalCacheMutation._variables`",

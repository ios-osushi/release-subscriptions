This fixes an issue where pre-release versions wouldn't show that they were installed in the output, but it also means that if a newer pre-release version is available than one that you have installed, it will still show as installed. For example, if you have 10.2.0-beta.4 installed, and 10.2.0-beta.5 becomes available, `xcodes list` will print the line `10.2 Beta 5 (Installed)`. I'd like to further improve this in the future, but I think this matches `xcode-version`'s behaviour for now.",

Failed authentications will prompt for your password in order to retry, and will also remove the password saved to the keychain for the Apple ID username. Thanks to @MattKiazyk for their work on this functionality! (#25, #32, #42)\r\n- Added an `xcodes version` command that prints the current version of xcodes itself. Thanks to @daveanderson for the feature suggestion! (#29)\r\n- xcodes developers can run `make project` to generate an Xcode project. Thanks to @thii for this addition! (#43)\r\n- @juankaram added installation instructions for [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) (#24)\r\n- The code signing certificate and identifier, and the application support directory have changed to reflect the move from https://github.com/interstateone to https://github.com/robotsandpencils. The application support directory will be automatically migrated if necessary. (#39)\r\n- xcodes has CI building and running tests now",

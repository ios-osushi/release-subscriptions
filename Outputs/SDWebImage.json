Developer should have the API to calculate the cache key from thumbnail or transformer, not hard-coded. #2966\r\n\r\n#### Context Option\r\n- Added new query cache type support, including the SDImageCache API and context option #2968\r\n- You use `.queryCacheType` to query image from memory/disk/both cache during image pipeline loading\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n- Fix the issue for Carthage/SwiftPM framework version symbols, this should match the framework name SDWebImage, or will get a link error when used #2971 #2969\r\n- Simplify the xattr helper method's code with modern Objective-C syntax #2967.

Update your codebase to use `SDWebImageContextImageDecodeOptions` to pass extra information from manager to coder. Loaded image will also store the same information in `image.sd_decodeOptions`\r\n- Refactor the hack when multiple different thumbnail image requests for same url called at the same time #3423\r\n- - Now the SDWebImageDownloader can callback each thumbnail request for same url with the correct image size as well (previously can't)\r\n- - Now if manager's callback image is thumbnail (`image.sd_isThumbnail == YES`), or transformed (`image.sd_isTransformed == YES`), the callback data will be nil. This because the image does not match downloaded data actually. If you really need original full size data, query the disk cache again using the original key. You may need `SDWebImageWaitStoreCache` options as well. (previously behavior is undefined, may callback with full size data, or encoded small size data, or even nil)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### Coder\r\n- Support use url.path or custom UTI hint passed to ImageIO, solve the TIFF/NEF/SRW raw image decoding with wrong size #3419\r\n- - Note from 5.14.0, we may pass the file extension to coder as a UTI hint\r\n- Added `SDImageCoderDecodeUseLazyDecoding` to control whether to use lazy-decoding for ImageIO #3425\r\n- - Note from 5.14.0, by default we enable lazy decoding for static image coder, disable lazy decoding for animated image coder, suitable for most cases. If you want, pass `.decodeUseLazyDecoding = YES` to context option `.imageDecodeOptions`\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Introduce new workaround to strip CGImage retained CGImageSource on iOS 15 #3425 #3387\r\n- - Note this also fix the limitation that you can not use lazy-decoding for animated image on iOS 15+. Pass `.decodeUseLazyDecoding = YES` to context option `.imageDecodeOptions`\r\n- Replace conformsToProtocol call with appropriate respondsToSelector check to improve performance #3429 Thanks @timonus \r\n- Fix del redundant autoreleasepool #3388 Thanks @dongranGG \r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n- Avoid store again when origin disk cache hit during Thumbnail or Transformer with smaller pixel size #3428 #3395\r\n- Add the possible nullable logic check when the force-decode/copy failed #3427",

Now you can directly pass it into new `encodedDataWithFrames:` APIs.\r\n\r\n#### Decoder\r\n- Update the decode solution to allows CoreGraphics avoid using any UIKit method #3468\r\n\r\n#### Cache\r\n- Seperate the SDImageCache encode queue and IO queue to match waitStoreCache behavior #3466\r\n- - Now, the encode process does not block IO queue and query disk cache faster. Previously `SDWebImageWaitStoreCache` is useless when you use transformer or cache serializer. Now you MUST pass this if you want to query disk cache inside completionBlock.\r\n\r\n#### Manager/Cache/Loader\r\n- Added context option callbackQueue and SDCallbackQueue wrapper for advanced user to control which queue to callback #3465 #3457\r\n- - If you want SDWebImage callback your completion in current non-main queue, pass `.context[.callbackQueue] = SDCallbackQueue.current`\r\n- Added SDWebImageContextImageEncodeOptions to pass encode options like compression quality to SDImageCache storeImage API #3466\r\n- - The re-encode and store cache logic happens if you use transformer or custom cache serializer, now you can pass the encode options.",

Developer should have the API to calculate the cache key from thumbnail or transformer, not hard-coded. #2966\r\n\r\n#### Context Option\r\n- Added new query cache type support, including the SDImageCache API and context option #2968\r\n- You use `.queryCacheType` to query image from memory/disk/both cache during image pipeline loading\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n- Fix the issue for Carthage/SwiftPM framework version symbols, this should match the framework name SDWebImage, or will get a link error when used #2971 #2969\r\n- Simplify the xattr helper method's code with modern Objective-C syntax #2967.

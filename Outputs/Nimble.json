There are 2 concrete implementations, `SyncExpectation` and `AsyncExpectation`. `AsyncExpectation` does not support `toEventually`, and is meant for awaiting on async functions. `SyncExpectation` is effectively the older `Expectation` implementation, and works as it used to. https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1004\r\n\r\n# Auto-generated release notes\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add support for watchOS by @JosephDuffy in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/916\r\n* Add @younata to funding.yml by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/994\r\n* Expose whether an expectation has passed and provide an option to throw by @bnickel in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/995\r\n* Raise minimum required OS and Swift Versions to Async-Support versions. by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/999\r\n* Don't strip whitespace from appended newlines by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1001\r\n* Allow toEventually to run on background threads by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1000\r\n* Allow using async/await in expect by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1004\r\n* Get toEventually et al working in async contexts. by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1007\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @JosephDuffy made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/916\r\n* @bnickel made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/995\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/compare/v10.0.0...v11.0.0",

There are typealiases for the older APIs to better enable migrations. These typealiases will be marked as removed in the next major version of Nimble (Nimble 14), and they will be removed entirely in Nimble 15.\r\n- Nimble now supports the DriverKit platform.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- The `Predicate` series of APIs have been renamed.\r\n- The `AsyncDefaults` struct is now marked as removed. It will be fully removed in the next major version of Nimble.\r\n- The platform-independent targets in `Nimble.xcodeproj` have now been consolidated into a single Nimble (and NimbleTests) target.\r\n\r\n## Other Notes\r\n\r\n- No changes since [Nimble 13 RC 1](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/releases/tag/v13.0.0-rc.1).\r\n\r\n# Automated Release Notes\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Update release script for a more modern-ish release process by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1086\r\n* Bump cocoapods from 1.12.1 to 1.13.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1089\r\n* Add Windows Support by @brianmichel in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1088\r\n* Rename Predicate to Matcher by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1090\r\n* Mark the AsyncDefaults struct as removed. by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1092\r\n* Consolidate xcodeproj targets (... again). by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1093\r\n* Bump actions/checkout from 3 to 4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1091\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @brianmichel made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1088\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/compare/v12.3.0...v13.0.0",

    "body" : "# Highlights\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n- Introduce the `require` dsl. This throws an error (a `RequireError`, or a custom one) if the matcher used with it fails. If the matcher doesn't fail, then the require dsl will return the result of the expression.\r\n  - For example, `try require([1, 2, 3]).to(haveCount(3))` will return `[1, 2, 3]`. However `try require(2).toEqual(1))` will throw a `RequireError`.\r\n  - When the matcher fails, `require` will still register the assertion failure with XCTest.\r\n  - This also adds `unwrap` and `pollUnwrap`, which are work as `try require(...).toNot(beNil())` and `try require(...).toEventuallyNot(beNil())`. With both sync and async variants. They either throw, or return non-optional versions of the expression.\r\n  - See the [documentation here](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/tree/v13.1.0#using-require-to-demand-that-a-matcher-pass-before-continuing) for more.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- Removes `Expectation.onFailure`, as the new `require` dsl entirely replaces that API. This deprecation will persist through Nimble 14, before being marked as removed in Nimble 15 and fully removed in Nimble 16.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- The `throwAssertion` matcher no longer supports watchOS and tvOS in the cocoapods distribution of Nimble. This is because Nimble no longer directly embeds the CwlCatchException CwlPreconditionTesting libraries used in that matcher and instead Nimble pulls in those libraries transitively through the package manager used.\r\n\r\n# Automated Release Notes\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Bump cocoapods from 1.13.0 to 1.14.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Nimble/pull/1094\r\n* Introduce the require dsl.

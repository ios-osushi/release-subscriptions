See the [`Package.swift` file](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/blob/master/Package.swift) file for an example of how to specify a dependency.\n- A nasty issue would cause Quick to fail to execute certain tests after the user ran a specific test via the Xcode test navigator (see https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/373 and https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/439) for details.

Although the names were a little hard to read, they were necessary in order to make sure examples with duplicate names were still run correctly (see the full discussion of the issue [here](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/295)). Now, thanks to @abbeycode, test names are dramatically shorter and easier to read, and Quick still behaves properly even when identical example names are used.\n\nWhen two or more examples share the same name, such as `\"it_is_an_example\"`, Quick now uses test names such as `\"it_is_an_example\"`, `\"it_is_an_example_2\"`, `\"it_is_an_example_3\"`, and so on.\n",

    "body" : "This closes the [v6.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/milestone/8).\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n\r\nSee additional details under the auto-generated release notes below.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n- No more sporadic crashes attempting to detect subclasses https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1156\r\n- Rerunning an individual test https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1166\r\n- Skipped tests are reported to Xcode https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1098\r\n\r\n## New\r\n\r\n- Async/await support. All tests now run in an async context. https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1160\r\n- You can now throw a `StopTest` error to end a test prematurely without it being reported as an error. https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1165\r\n- Added the `justBeforeEach` operator, which takes a closure and runs it immediately prior to the relevant `it` tests. https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1169 For example\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nvar ordering: [Int] = []\r\nbeforeEach {\r\n    ordering.append(1)\r\n}\r\n\r\njustBeforeEach {\r\n    ordering.append(3)\r\n}\r\n\r\nbeforeEach {\r\n    ordering.append(2)\r\n}\r\n\r\nit(\"runs justBeforeEach after the other beforeEach's\") {\r\n    expect(ordering).to(equal([1, 2, 3]))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Breaking\r\n\r\n- This version raises minimum required version to Swift 5.6, and required OS to macOS 10.15, iOS 13, and tvOS 13.\r\n- `aroundEach` is removed from the Objective-C API https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1160\r\n- Again, with the async support, all tests now run in an async context. This will require you to make changes, especially if you use Nimble.\r\n\r\n# Auto-Generated Release Notes\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Create funding.yml by @jessesquires in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1147\r\n* Report skipped tests to Xcode by @amomchilov in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1098\r\n* Bump danger from 8.6.0 to 8.6.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1148\r\n* Renamed Configuration -> QCKConfiguration on documentation by @takehilo in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1152\r\n* Fix sporadic crashes caused by finding classes that don't play well with isSubclass(of:) by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1156\r\n* Raise minimum supported versions to macOS 10.15, iOS 13, tvOS 13 by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1146\r\n* version up Nimble in Package.swift by @kimxwan0319 in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1153\r\n* Update Nimble submodule checkout to refer to the Nimble v10.0.0 commit by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1157\r\n* Fix tests broken by Nimble 10 update by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1158\r\n* Add @younata to funding.yml by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1164\r\n* Bump danger from 8.6.1 to 9.0.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1168\r\n* Allow throwing in a test without producing an unexpected error by @bnickel in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1165\r\n* Allow rerunning individual examples in Xcode by @bnickel in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1166\r\n* Bump fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions from 4.0.0 to 5.1.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1171\r\n* Introduce an `assignBefore` operator by @esilverberg in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1169\r\n* Bump fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions from 5.1.0 to 5.2.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1172\r\n* Add support for xcode 14 and swift 5.7 by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1174\r\n* Swift Async/Await Support by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1160\r\n* Update Nimble to V11 by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1175\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @amomchilov made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1098\r\n* @takehilo made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1152\r\n* @kimxwan0319 made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1153\r\n* @bnickel made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1165\r\n* @esilverberg made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1169\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Quick/Quick/compare/v5.0.1...v6.0.0",

If you have any test helpers that exist on properties of your QuickSpec subclasses, the you will need to either move them inside of the `spec` function, or outside to another scope. For Objective-C users, this is, for the most part, a drop-in replacement. You will only need to do anything if you do not use the `QuickSpecBegin` and `QuickSpecEnd` macros (in which case: do a find & replace of the regex `-(\\s*)\\(void\\)(\\s*)spec` with `+$1(void)$2spec`).\r\n\r\nFor migrating from Quick 6 to Quick 7, it would be easiest to also do a Find & Replace of `: QuickSpec` to `: AsyncSpec`, then migrate tests that do not need to run in async contexts to be `QuickSpec`s themselves.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to check this out, and to share feedback by filing an issue or discussing this in the discussions.\r\n\r\n# Auto-Generated Changelog\r\n\r\n## Beta 3 Changes\r\n* Add mechanism to fallback to legacy test selector names by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1211\r\n* Don't imply that we plan to remove the option to force encoded test selector names by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1212\r\n\r\n## Beta 2 Changes\r\n* Bump git from 1.12.0 to 1.13.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1191\r\n* Bump activesupport from 6.1.5 to 6.1.7.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1196\r\n* Bump danger from 9.1.0 to 9.2.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1198\r\n* Bump cocoapods from 1.11.3 to 1.12.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1201\r\n* Bump activesupport from 7.0.4.2 to 7.0.4.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1203\r\n* Bump fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions from 5.2.0 to 5.3.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1188\r\n* [Translation] AsyncAwait.md Korean translation by @tisohjung in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1204\r\n* Update Nimble to v12 by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1206\r\n* Demangle QuickSpec test names as much as possible by @younata in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1207\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @tisohjung made their first contribution in https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/1204\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Quick/Quick/compare/v7.0.0-beta.2...v7.0.0-beta.3",

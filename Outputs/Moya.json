We deprecated reactive providers and started using `rx` and `reactive` namespaces.\r\n2. We removed `parameters`, `parameterEncoding` and expanded `task`. \r\n\r\nWe also added Swift 4.0 support to Moya core (and preliminary for `ReactiveSwift`) where support for `RxSwift` will be in a next major release. We improved our test coverage from 76% up to 83%, added `callbackQueue`s as an option for all requests (reactive or not!), `headers` to `TargetType`, improved `AccessTokenPlugin`, started using `Single<Response>` instead of `Observable<Response>` for RxSwift normal requests and many, many more! Checkout the changelog below and have fun! üéâ There is also a [migration guide](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/blob/master/docs/MigrationGuides.md) to help you make it through! \r\n\r\nOh, and if you find anything you are concerned about, [make a new Issue](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/issues/new) - or better yet, [make a PR](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/compare) with the fix! üòâ \r\n\r\n## Changes since 9.0.0-beta.1:\r\n- Removed default value for task from `Endpoint` initializer.\r\n\r\n## Full changelog for Moya 9.0.0:\r\n- **Breaking Change** Added support to get the response (if any) from `MoyaError`.\r\n- **Breaking Change** Added `headers` to `TargetType`.\r\n- **Breaking Change** Updated `RxMoyaProvider.request` to return a [`Single<Request>`](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/pull/1123).\r\n- **Breaking Change** Updated `Moya.Response`'s `response`to use an `HTTPURLResponse` instead of a `URLResponse`.\r\n- **Breaking Change** Updated `TargetTypes` so it no longer receives the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header by default when using `AccessTokenPlugin`.\r\n- **Breaking Change** Renamed all occurrences of `queue` to `callbackQueue`.\r\n- **Breaking Change** Deprecated `ReactiveSwiftMoyaProvider` and `RxSwiftMoyaProvider`.

However in order to reap benefits of the new `source` (which will contain the \"module name from which this log message originates\") parameter, they will have to change which `log` overload they implement. We suggest moving to implementing the _new_ overload (with `source:`) as soon as possible, allowing the logging ecosystem to make use of this new capability.\r\n\r\nFor details  see:\r\n\r\n- Add \"source\" for log messages https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/135 \r\n\r\n### SemVer Minor\r\n\r\n- Add \"source\" for log messages https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/135\r\n- Add NoOpLogHandler for when you don't want logging https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/142\r\n- Logging: port to Windows https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/118\r\n- =multiplex #139 more properly handle logLevel in multiplex handler https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/140\r\n  - Note that previous behavior of the `MultiplexLogHandler` was very surprising and this change makes it more consistent, see the PR for details if you are using multiplex handlers\r\n\r\n### SemVer Patch\r\n\r\n- silence #file to #filePath warnings https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/133\r\n- a number of readme and docs improvements:\r\n  - docs: =doc #82 avoid showcasing internal lock in public docs https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/144\r\n  - Fix doc typo #134 \r\n  - Add more syntax highlighting to the readme file #114 \r\n- and more, see the [1.3.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/milestone/5?closed=1) milestone for all closed issues.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThis release includes 15 issues/PRs, which were made possible with the help of 18 contributors ðŸŽ‰ \r\n\r\nWe would like to thank all everyone for their feedback and contributions:\r\n\r\nTomer Doron, Johannes Weiss, Konrad `ktoso` Malawski, Saleem Abdulrasool, Gwynne Raskind, prafsoni, Adam Fowler, Neal Lester, Artur Dryomov, Franz Busch, Shiva Huang, zach wick, Ravi Kandhadai, YR Chen, Jeremy Greenwood, Will Lisac, Mattt, Tanner\r\n\r\nThank you!",

This works extremely well with systems like distributed tracing, that may pick up trace identifiers and other information from the task-local context from where the log statement is being made.\r\n\r\nThe feature came with a [swift evolution style proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/main/proposals/0001-metadata-providers.md) introduction to the \"why?\" and \"how?\" of this feature you may find interesting.\r\n\r\nMetadata providers are used like this:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nimport Logging\r\n\r\nenum Namespace { \r\n  @TaskLocal var simpleTraceID: String?\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet simpleTraceIDMetadataProvider = Logger.MetadataProvider { \r\n    guard let traceID = Namespace.simpleTraceID else {\r\n        return [:]\r\n    }\r\n    return [\"simple-trace-id\": .string(traceID)]\r\n }\r\n\r\nLoggingSystem.bootstrapInternal({ label, metadataProvider in\r\n    myCoolLogHandler(label: label, metadataProvider: metadataProvider)\r\n}, metadataProvider: simpleTraceIDMetadataProvider)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich in turn makes every `Logger` on this `LoggingSystem` add this contextual metadata to log statements automatically:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet log = Logger(label: \"hello\")\r\n\r\nNamespace.simpleTraceID.withValue(\"1234-5678\") {\r\n  test()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc test() {\r\n  log.info(\"test log statement\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// [info] [simple-trace-id: 1234-5678] test log statement\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Adoption in `LogHandler`s\r\n\r\nIn order to support this new feature in your log handlers, please make it accept a `MetadataProvider?` at creation, and store it as:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct MyHandler: LogHandler {\r\n    // ... \r\n    public var metadataProvider: Logger.MetadataProvider?\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Highlight \r\n* Metadata Providers (e.g. for Distributed Tracing) in LogHandlers by @ktoso in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/238\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n* [docs] Minimal docc setup and landing page by @ktoso in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/226\r\n* =docc Make docs use symbol references by @ktoso in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/230\r\n* =docc Move to multiple Package.swift files by @ktoso in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/231\r\n* Undo 5.7 package files, not needed yet by @ktoso in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/232\r\n* Update README: Add missing Source param by @Rusik in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/233\r\n* Fix build for wasm by @ahti in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/236\r\n* Add .spi.yml for Swift Package Index DocC support by @yim-lee in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/240\r\n* Fixes link to Supabase repository in README.md by @timobollwerk in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/245\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Rusik made their first contribution in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/233\r\n* @ahti made their first contribution in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/236\r\n* @timobollwerk made their first contribution in https://github.com/apple/swift-log/pull/245\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/apple/swift-log/compare/1.4.4...1.5.0",

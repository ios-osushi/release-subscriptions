For example - `throttle(1.2)` would change to `throttle(.milliseconds(1200))`, while `throttle(3)` would change to `throttle(.seconds(3))`. #1472\r\n* `Variable` is now entirely deprecated. #1922\r\n* `do` now provides additional \"_after_\" closures. For example, `do(onNext:)` and `do(afterNext:)`. #1898\r\n* `bind(to:)` now supports multiple observers (e.g. `bind(to: observer1, observer2)`). #1702\r\n* Changes the return type of `ObservableType.toArray` to `Single`. #1923\r\n* Adds `compactMap`. #1925\r\n* Deprecate `Completable.merge` in favor of `Completable.zip`. #1929 #1931\r\n* RxSwift can be built as a Static Library using Carthage 0.33 and up. #1940\r\n\r\n### Anomalies\r\n\r\n* `SubjectType.SubjectObserverType` has been renamed to `SubjectType.Observer`. #1950\r\n* The `S` associated type has been renamed to `Subject` where applicable. #1950\r\n* The `S` generic constraint on `SharedSequence` has been renamed to `SharingStrategy`. #1951\r\n* The `E` associated type on `ObservableConvertibleType` and `ObserverType` have been renamed to `Element`. #1945\r\n* The `C` and `S` associated types have been renamed to `Collection` and `Sequence` accordingly. #1949\r\n* Renamed `ElementType` associatedtype to `Element`. #1945\r\n* Renamed `TraitType` associatedtype to `Trait`. #1945\r\n* Make `RxMutableBox` supported on Linux in Swift 5. #1917\r\n* Fix incorrect assignment to `Thread.threadDictionary` on Linux. #1912\r\n* `combineLatest` of an empty array now completes immediately. #1879\r\n* Add `resultsSelector` missing closure labels for some overloads of `combineLatest` & `zip`.\r\n",

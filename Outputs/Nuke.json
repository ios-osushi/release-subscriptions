    "body" : "Nuke 10 is extreme in every way. It is faster than the previous version (up to 30% improvement to some operations), more powerful, more ergonomic, and is even easier to learn and use. It brings big additions to the caching infrastructure, great SwiftUI and Combine support, and more ways to adjust the system to fit your needs.\r\n\r\nThis release is also a massive step-up in the general quality of the framework. It has many improvements to the docs (for example, a complete rewrite of the [caching guide](https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/caching)), more inline comments, more unit tests (Nuke now has ~100% test coverage with 2x number of lines of code in the test target compared to the main target). It's as reliable as it gets.\r\n\r\n> **Migration.** The compiler will assist you with the migration, but if something isn't clear, there is a comprehensive [migration guide](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Migrations/Nuke%2010%20Migration%20Guide.md) available.\r\n>\r\n> **Switching.** Switching from Kingfisher? There is now a [dedicated guide](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Switch/switch-from-kingfisher.md) available to assist you. There is also one for [migrating from SDWebImage](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Switch/switch-from-sdwebimage.md).\r\n\r\n## Caching\r\n\r\n- Add [`DataCachePolicy`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipeline_Configuration_DataCachePolicy/) to replace deprecated `DataCacheOptions.storedItems`. The new policy fixes some of the inefficiencies of the previous model and provides more control. For example, one of the additions is an [`.automatic`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipeline_Configuration_DataCachePolicy/#imagepipeline.configuration.datacachepolicy.automatic) policy: for requests with processors, encode and store processed images; for requests with no processors, store original image data. You can learn more about the policies and other caching changes in [\"Caching: Cache Policy.\"](https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/caching#cache-policy)\r\n-  Add [`ImagePipeline.Cache`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipeline_Cache/) with a whole range of convenience APIs for managing cached images: read, write, remove images from all cache layers.\r\n- Add [`ImagePipeline.Configuration.withDataCache`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipeline_Configuration/#imagepipeline.configuration.withdatacache) (aggressive disk cache enabled) and [`withURLCache`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipeline_Configuration/#imagepipeline.configuration.withurlcache) (HTTP disk cache enabled) to make it easier to set up a pipeline with a configuration you want. Learn more in [\"Caching: Configuration.\"](https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/caching#configuration)\r\n- Add `removeAll()` method to `ImageCaching` and `DataCaching` protocols\r\n- Add `containsData(for:)` method to `DataCaching` and `DataCache` which checks if the data exists without bringing it to memory\r\n- Add [`ImageResponse.CacheType`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageResponse_CacheType/) to address [#361](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/361) and [#435](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/435). It defines the source of the retrieved image.\r\n- The pipeline no longer stores images fetched using file:// and data:// schemes in the disk cache\r\n- `ImageCaching` protocols now works with a new [`ImageCacheKey`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageCacheKey/) type (an opaque container) instead of `ImageRequest`. If you are providing a custom implementation of the `ImageCaching` protocol, it needs to be updated. It is now easier because there is no need to come up with a key.\r\n\r\n## NukeUI (Beta)\r\n\r\n[NukeUI](https://github.com/kean/NukeUI) is a new Swift package. It is a comprehensive solution for displaying lazily loaded images on Apple platforms. The library contains two types:\r\n\r\n- `LazyImage` for SwiftUI\r\n- `LazyImageView` for UIKit and AppKit\r\n\r\nBoth views have an equivalent sets of APIs.\r\n\r\nThe library uses [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) for loading images and has many customization options. It also supports GIF rendering thanks to [Gifu](https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu). GIF is [not the most](https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/) efficient format, so NukeUI also supports playing short videos out of the box.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct ContainerView: View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        LazyImage(source: \"https://example.com/image.jpeg\")\r\n            .placeholder { Image(\"placeholder\") }\r\n            .transition(.fadeIn(duration: 0.33))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## SwiftUI\r\n\r\nNuke now has first-class SwiftUI support with [FetchImage](https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/swiftui) which is now part of the main repo, no need to install it separately. It also has a couple of new additions:\r\n\r\n- Add `result` property (previously you could only access the loaded image)\r\n- Add `AnyPublisher` support via a new `func load<P: Publisher>(_ publisher: P) where P.Output == ImageResponse, P.Failure == ImagePipeline.Error` method. You can use it with a custom publisher created by combining publishers introduced in [Nuke 9.6](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/releases/tag/9.6.0).\r\n- Add `ImageRequestConvertible` support\r\n\r\n## Combine\r\n\r\nNuke 10 goes all-in on Combine. [`ImagePublisher`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePublisher/) was initially introduced in the previous release, [Nuke 9.6](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/releases/tag/9.6.0), and now Combine is supported across the framework.\r\n\r\n- `ImageRequest` now supports Combine Publisher via a new initializer `ImageRequest(id:data:)` where `data` is a `Publisher`. It can be used in a variety of scenarios, for example, loading data using `PhotosKit.\r\n- As mentioned earlier, [`FetchImage`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/FetchImage/) now also supports publishers. So when you create a publisher chain, there is now an easy way to display it.\r\n\r\n## ImageRequest.Options\r\n\r\nNuke 10 has a reworked [`ImageRequest.Options`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_Options/) option set replacing removed `ImageRequestOptions`. The name is similar, but the options are slightly different. The new approach has more options while being optimized for performance. `ImageRequest` size in memory reduced from 176 bytes to just 48 bytes (3.7x smaller).\r\n\r\n- Deprecate [`ImageRequest.CachePolicy`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_CachePolicy/) which is now part of the new [`ImageRequest.Options`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_Options/) option set\r\n- Remove `filteredURL`, you can now pass it using `userInfo` and [`.imageIdKey`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_UserInfoKey/#imagerequest.userinfokey.imageidkey) key instead. It's a rarely used option, and this is why it is now less visible.\r\n- Remove `cacheKey` and `loadKey` (hopefully, nobody is using it because these weren't really designed properly). You can now use the new methods of [`ImagePipeline.Delegate`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipelineDelegate/) that allows customizing the keys.\r\n- Add more options for granular control over caching and loading. For example, [`ImageRequest.Options`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_Options/) has a new [`.disableDiskCache`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_Options/#imagerequest.options.disablediskcache) option.\r\n- Move `userInfo` directly to `ImageRequest`. It's now easier to pass and it allows the framework to perform some additional optimizations.\r\n- `userInfo` now uses [`ImageRequest.UserInfoKey`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequest_UserInfoKey/) wrapper for keys replacing `AnyHashable`. The new approach is faster and adds type-safety.\r\n\r\n## ImagePipeline.Delegate\r\n\r\n- Add [`ImagePipeline.Delegate`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipelineDelegate/) with a variety of advanced per-request customization options that were previously not possible. For example, with [`dataCache(for:pipeline:)`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipelineDelegate/) method you can specify a disk cache for each request. With [`will​Cache(data:​image:​for:​pipeline:​completion:​)`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImagePipelineDelegate/#imagepipelinedelegate.willcache(data:image:for:pipeline:completion:)) you can disable caching per-request or modify the cached data. And there are more.\r\n- Deprecated `ImagePipelineObserving` protocol is now fully covered by `ImagePipeline.Delegate`\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n- `ImageRequest` size in memory reduced from 176 bytes to just 48 bytes (3.7x smaller), which is due to the OptionSet usage and also reordering of properties to take advantage of gaps in memory stride. The size of other types was also reduced, but not as dramatically. For example, `ImageTask` and `ImagePipeline.Configuration` now also take a bit less memory\r\n- Coalescing now supports even more scenarios. For example, setting `ImageRequest` `options` with a cache policy no longer prevents coalescing of data tasks.\r\n- The pipeline now performs memory cache lookup of intermediate (not all processors are applied) progressive image previews and apply the remaining processors on demand\r\n- Extend fast track decoding to the disk cache lookup\r\n- For cache policies that require image encoding, encode decompressed images instead of uncompressed ones\r\n\r\n## Nuke Builder\r\n\r\n[NukeBuilder](https://github.com/kean/NukeBuilder/) is a package that adds a convenience API for creating image requests inspired by SwiftUI. It was updated with support Nuke 10 and some quality-of-life improvements.\r\n\r\n- Rename package to NukeBuilder\r\n- Update to Nuke 10.0\r\n- Add [`ImageRequestConvertible`](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/10.0.0/ImageRequestConvertible/) support which means it now supports more types: `URLRequest` and `String`\r\n- Add Combine support\r\n- Add `ImagePipeline` typealias for convenience – you only need to import `NukeBuilder` in many cases\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n- Increase minimum required Xcode version to 12; no changes to the supported platforms\r\n- `Nuke.loadImage()` methods now work with optional image requests. If the request is `nil`, it handles the scenario the same way as failure.\r\n- `ImageRequest` now also works with optional `URL`\r\n- `String` now also conforms to `ImageRequestConvertible`, closes [#421](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/421)\r\n- Optional `URL` now also conforms to `ImageRequestConvertible`\r\n- Streamline pipeline callback closures\r\n- Pass failing processor to `ImagePipeline.Error.processingFailed`\r\n- Add type-safe `ImageContainer.UserInfoKey` and `ImageRequest.UserInfoKey`\r\n- Pass additional parameter `Data?` to `nuke_display` (ImageView extensions)\r\n- `ImagePrefetcher` now always sets the priority of the requests to its priority\r\n- `ImagePrefetcher` now works with `ImageRequestConvertible`, adding support for `URLRequest` and `String`\r\n- `ImagePipeline` can now be invalidated with `invalidate()` method\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nThere are deprecation warnings in place to help guide you through the migration process.\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `ImageRequestOptions`, use `ImageRequest.Options` instead (it's not just the name change)\r\n- Deprecate `ImagePipelineObserving`, use `imageTask(_:,didReceiveEvent)` from `ImagePipeline.Delegate` instead\r\n- Rename `isDeduplicationEnabled` to `isTaskCoalescingEnabled`\r\n- Deprecate `animatedImageData` associated object for platform images. Use `data` property of `ImageContainer` instead. `animatedImageData` was initially soft-deprecated in Nuke 9.0.\r\n- Deprecate the default `processors` in `ImagePipeline`; use the new `processors` options in `ImageLoadingOptions` instead\r\n- Deprecate `ImageEncoder` and `ImageDecoder` typealiases.\r\n",

The documentation hasn't been updated yet.\r\n\r\n## NukeUI 2.0\r\n\r\nNukeUI started as a separate [repo](https://github.com/kean/NukeUI), but the initial production version was released as part of [Nuke 11](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/releases/tag/11.0.0). Let's call it NukeUI 1.0. The framework was designed before the [`AsyncImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage) announcement and had a few discrepancies that made it harder to migrate from `AsyncImage`. This release addresses the shortcomings of the original design.\r\n\r\nStarting with NukeUI 2.0, `LazyImage` uses `SwiftUI.Image` to display images and eliminates any [discrepancies](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/578) between `LazyImage` and `AsyncImage` layout and self-sizing behavior. And the previously used `NukeUI.Image` was removed so it no longer [conflicts](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/discussions/658) with `SwiftUI.Image`.\r\n\r\nNukeUI 1.0 tried to do too much in terms of _rendering_ images which is not its primary responsibility – _loading_ images is. The original design resulted in a convoluted and poorly composable API where `LazyImage` would know too much about how the images are rendered. This is no longer the case.\r\n\r\n- `LazyImage` now uses `SwiftUI.Image` for rendering images and the layout/sizing behavior matches `AsyncImage` exactly \r\n- Remove `Image`, `ImageView`, `ImageResizingMode`\r\n- Add `LazyImage` initializer that accepts `content` and `placeholder` closures (the same as `AsyncImage`)\r\n- Add `scale` parameter to `LazyImage` initializer \r\n- GIF rendering is no longer included in the framework. To enable it, use one of the frameworks that support GIF directly, such as [Gifu](https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu) \r\n- Video support is also disabled by default (this is subject to change)\r\n\r\n> **Warning**: GIF and video rendering are now disabled by default \r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nThis release also removes the APIs deprecated in the previous versions of the framework",

This release addresses the shortcomings of the original design and features a couple of performance improvements.\r\n\r\n- `LazyImage` now uses `SwiftUI.Image` instead of `NukeUI.Image` backed by `UIImageView` and `NSImageView`. It eliminates any [discrepancies](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/578) between `LazyImage` and `AsyncImage` layout and self-sizing behavior and fixes issues with `.redacted(reason:)`, `ImageRenderer`, and other SwiftUI APIs that don't work with UIKIt and AppKit based views.\r\n- Remove `NukeUI.Image` so the name no longer [clashes](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/discussions/658) with `SwiftUI.Image`\r\n- Fix [#669](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/669): `redacted` not working for `LazyImage`\r\n- GIF rendering is no longer included in the framework. Please consider using one of the framework that specialize on playing GIFs, such as [Gifu](https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu). It's easy to integrate, especially with `LazyImage`.\r\n- Extract progress updates from `FetchImage` to a separate observable object, reducing the number of body reloads\r\n- `LazyImage` now requires a single body calculation to render the response from the memory cache (instead of three before)\r\n- Disable animations by default\r\n- Fix an issue where the image won't reload if you change only `LazyImage` `processors` or `priority` without also changing the image source\r\n- `FetchImage/image` now returns `Image` instead of `UIImage`\r\n- Make `_PlatformImageView` internal (was public) and remove more typealiases\r\n\r\n## Nuke\r\n\r\n- ImageCache uses 20% of available RAM which is quite aggressive. It's an OK default on iOS because it clears 90% of the used RAM when entering the background to be a good citizen. But it's not a good default on a Mac. Starting with Nuke 12, the default size is now strictly limited to 512 MB.\r\n- `ImageDecoder` now defaults to scale `1` for images (configurable using [`UserInfoKey/scaleKey`](https://kean-docs.github.io/nuke/documentation/nuke/imagerequest/userinfokey/scalekey))\r\n- Removes APIs deprecated in the previous versions\r\n\r\n## NukeVideo\r\n\r\nVideo playback can be significantly [more efficient](https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/) than playing animated GIFs. This is why the initial version of NukeUI provided support for basic video playback. But it is not something that the majority of the users need, so this feature was extracted to a separate module called `NukeVideo`.\r\n\r\nThere is now less code that you need to include in your project, which means faster compile time and smaller code size. With this and some other changes in Nuke 12, the two main frameworks – Nuke and NukeUI – now have 25% less code compared to Nuke 11. In addition to this change, there are a couple of improvements in how the precompiled binary frameworks are generated, significantly reducing their size.\r\n\r\n- Move all video-related code to `NukeVideo`\r\n- Remove `ImageContainer.asset`. The asset is now added to `ImageContainer/userInfo` under the new `.videoAssetKey`.\r\n- Reduce the size of binary frameworks",

The minimum requirements are unchanged from Nuke 11.\r\n\r\n## Concurrency\r\n\r\nRedesign the concurrency APIs making them more ergonomic and fully `Sendable` compliant.\r\n\r\n- Add `ImagePipeline/imageTask(with:)` method that returns a new type `AsyncImageTask`\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet task = ImagePipeline.shared.imageTask(with: URL(string: \"example.com\"))\r\ntask.priority = .high\r\nfor await progress in task.progress {\r\n    print(\"Updated progress: \", progress)\r\n}\r\nlet image = try await task.image\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The existing convenience `ImagePipeline/image(for:)` method now returns an image instead of `ImageResponse`\r\n- Remove the `delegate` parameter from `ImagePipeline/image(for:)` method to address the upcoming concurrency warnings in Xcode 14.3\r\n- Remove `ImageTaskDelegate` and move its methods to `ImagePipelineDelegate` and add the `pipeline` parameter\r\n\r\n## NukeUI 2.0\r\n\r\nNukeUI started as a separate [repo](https://github.com/kean/NukeUI), but the initial production version was released as part of [Nuke 11](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/releases/tag/11.0.0). Let's call it NukeUI 1.0. The framework was designed before the [`AsyncImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage) announcement and had a few discrepancies that made it harder to migrate from `AsyncImage`. This release addresses the shortcomings of the original design and features a couple of performance improvements.\r\n\r\n- `LazyImage` now uses `SwiftUI.Image` instead of `NukeUI.Image` backed by `UIImageView` and `NSImageView`. It eliminates any [discrepancies](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/578) between `LazyImage` and `AsyncImage` layout and self-sizing behavior and fixes issues with `.redacted(reason:)`, `ImageRenderer`, and other SwiftUI APIs that don't work with UIKIt and AppKit based views.\r\n- Remove `NukeUI.Image` so the name no longer [clashes](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/discussions/658) with `SwiftUI.Image`\r\n- Fix [#669](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/669): `redacted` not working for `LazyImage`\r\n- GIF rendering is no longer included in the framework. Please consider using one of the frameworks that specialize in playing GIFs, such as [Gifu](https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu). It's easy to integrate, especially with `LazyImage`.\r\n- Extract progress updates from `FetchImage` to a separate observable object, reducing the number of body reloads\r\n- `LazyImage` now requires a single body calculation to render the response from the memory cache (instead of three before)\r\n- Disable animations by default\r\n- Fix an issue where the image won't reload if you change only `LazyImage` `processors` or `priority` without also changing the image source\r\n- `FetchImage/image` now returns `Image` instead of `UIImage`\r\n- Make `_PlatformImageView` internal (was public) and remove more typealiases\r\n\r\n## Nuke\r\n\r\n- Add a new initializer to `ImageRequest.ThumbnailOptions` that accepts the target size, unit, and content mode - [#677](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/pull/677)\r\n- ImageCache uses 20% of available RAM which is quite aggressive. It's an OK default on iOS because it clears 90% of the used RAM when entering the background to be a good citizen. But it's not a good default on a Mac. Starting with Nuke 12, the default size is now strictly limited to 512 MB.\r\n- `ImageDecoder` now defaults to scale `1` for images (configurable using [`UserInfoKey/scaleKey`](https://kean-docs.github.io/nuke/documentation/nuke/imagerequest/userinfokey/scalekey))\r\n- Removes APIs deprecated in the previous versions\r\n- Update the [Performance Guide](https://kean-docs.github.io/nuke/documentation/nuke/performance-guide)\r\n\r\n## NukeVideo\r\n\r\nVideo playback can be significantly [more efficient](https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/) than playing animated GIFs. This is why the initial version of NukeUI provided support for basic video playback. But it is not something that the majority of the users need, so this feature was extracted to a separate module called `NukeVideo`.\r\n\r\nThere is now less code that you need to include in your project, which means faster compile time and smaller code size. With this and some other changes in Nuke 12, the two main frameworks – Nuke and NukeUI – now have 25% less code compared to Nuke 11. In addition to this change, there are a couple of improvements in how the precompiled binary frameworks are generated, significantly reducing their size.\r\n\r\n- Move all video-related code to `NukeVideo`\r\n- Remove `ImageContainer.asset`. The asset is now added to `ImageContainer/userInfo` under the new `.videoAssetKey`.\r\n- Reduce the size of binary frameworks by up to 50%",

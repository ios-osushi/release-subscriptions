Previous releases were not matching the Protobuf Spec which calls for unknown fields to error.  The spec does allow for an option to request that unknown fields are silently dropped.  So this release includes the fix to error for unknown fields, but adds an option to `JSONDecodingOptions` to request unknown fields be ignored instead of causing the failure.

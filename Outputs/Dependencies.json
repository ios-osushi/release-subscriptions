This helps propagate dependencies further, especially when dependencies hold onto their own dependencies via the `@Dependency` property wrapper.\r\n* Changed: A debug task local will now be compiled out of release mode, making dependency access slightly faster (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies/pull/62).\r\n* Changed: `TestDependencyKey` now constrains its `Value` associated type to be `Sendable` in Swift >=5.7.1 (thanks @adriansergheev, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies/pull/68).\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @adriansergheev made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies/pull/68\r\n* @iampatbrown made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies/pull/71\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies/compare/0.2.0...0.3.0",

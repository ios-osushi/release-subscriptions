Accesses to `fixItID` are deprecated and forward to `noteID`. Any types that conform `NoteMessage` it will need to be updated to provide a `noteID` instead of a `fixItID`.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2261\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2264\r\n\r\n- `DiagnosticSpec.highlight` replaced by `highlights`\r\n  - Description: The use of a single string `highlight` prevented users from asserting that a macro highlighted exactly the expected set of syntax nodes. Use of `DiagnosticSpec.init(...highlight:...)` is deprecated and forwards to `DiagnosticSpec.init(...highlights:...)`. Migrating from `highlight` to `highlights` is straightforward; any uses of `DiagnosticSpec.init` which do not specify a `highlight` do not need to change, otherwise:\r\n    - If the diagnostic highlights a single node, the `highlight` string should be replaced with a single element array containing the same string without any trailing trivia, e.g., `highlight: \"let \"` -> `highlights: [\"let\"]`.\r\n    - If the diagnostic highlights multiple nodes, the `highlight` string should be replaced with an array containing an element for each highlighted node, e.g., `highlight: \"struct {}\"` -> `highlights: [\"struct\", \"{}\"]`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2213\r\n",

Additionally, type specifiers can now contain arguments, like `borrow(data)`. To facilitate this, the following new types were introduces: `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentListSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentsSyntax`, `LifetimeTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `SimpleTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `TypeSpecifierListSyntax`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2433\r\n\r\n- `DeclGroupSyntax.introducer`\r\n  - Description: The `DeclGroupSyntax` trait has an extra `introducer` property, ie. the keyword that introduces the declaration.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp/issues/2535\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2539\r\n\r\n- `ExprSyntax.interpretedAsVersionTuple`\r\n  - Description: With the change to parse `#if canImport(MyModule, _version: 1.2.3)` as a function call instead of a dedicated syntax node, `1.2.3` natively gets parsed as a member access `3` to the `1.2` float literal. This property allows the reinterpretation of such an expression as a version tuple.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2025\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxProtocol.node(at:)` \r\n  - Description: Given a `SyntaxIdentifier`, returns the `Syntax` node with that identifier\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier.IndexInTree`\r\n  - Description: Uniquely identifies a syntax node within a tree. This is similar to ``SyntaxIdentifier`` but does not store the root ID of the tree. It can thus be transferred across trees that are structurally equivalent, for example two copies of the same tree that live in different processes. The only public functions on this type are `toOpaque` and `init(fromOpaque:)`, which allow serialization of the `IndexInTree`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n  \r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier` conformance to `Comparable`:\r\n  - Description: A `SyntaxIdentifier` compares less than another `SyntaxIdentifier` if the node at that identifier occurs first during a depth-first traversal of the tree.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxIdentifier.indexInTree` and `SyntaxIdentifier.fromIndexInTree` \r\n  - Description: `SyntaxIdentifier.indexInTree` allows the retrieval of a `SyntaxIdentifier` that identifies the syntax node independent of the syntax tree. `SyntaxIdentifier.fromIndexInTree` allows the creation for a `SyntaxIdentifier` from a tree-agnostic `SyntaxIdentifier.IndexInTree` and the tree's root node.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2594\r\n\r\n- `SwiftSyntaxMacrosGenericTestSupport`\r\n  - Description: A version of the `SwiftSyntaxMacrosTestSupport` module that doesn't depend on `Foundation` or `XCTest` and can thus be used to write macro tests using `swift-testing`. Since swift-syntax can't depend on swift-testing (which would incur a circular dependency since swift-testing depends on swift-syntax), users need to manually specify a failure handler like the following, that fails the swift-testing test: `Issue.record(\"\\($0.message)\", fileID: $0.location.fileID, filePath: $0.location.filePath, line: $0.location.line, column: $0.location.column)`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2647\r\n\r\n- `TokenSyntax.identifier`\r\n  - Description: Adds an `identifier` property to `TokenSyntax` which returns a canonicalized representation of an identifier that strips away backticks.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2576\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- Child Choice Node Casts\r\n  - Description: `is`, `as`, and `cast` methods for types not contained in the choice node are marked as deprecated. The deprecated methods will emit a warning, indicating that the cast will always fail.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2092\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2184\r\n  - Migration steps: Remove the `is`, `as` or `cast` methods because they will always fail.\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalParseTransition`:\r\n  - Description: The initializer `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousTree:edits:lookaheadRanges:reusedNodeCallback:)` is marked as deprecated. Use `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2267\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2272\r\n  - Migration steps: Call `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.\r\n\r\n- `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` moved to the `SwiftSyntaxMacros` module\r\n  - Description: Move the `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` types from the `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` module to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`. Deprecated typealiases in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` forward to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2338\r\n  - Notes: The expansion diagnostic messages were defined in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion`, which is intended as an implementation detail of the plugin server and should not need to be imported by macros.\r\n\r\n- `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax`:\r\n  - Description: `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax` are now deprecated and placeholders are instead parsed as identifiers within a `MissingDeclSyntax` or `DeclReferenceExprSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2237\r\n\r\n- `AttributedTypeSyntax.specifier` has renamed to `specifiers` and changed to be a collection\r\n  - Description: Types can have multiple specifiers now and the syntax tree has been modified to reflect that.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2433\r\n\r\n- ` CanImportExprSyntax` and `CanImportVersionInfoSyntax`\r\n  - Description: Instead of parsing `canImport` inside `#if` directives as a special expression node, parse it as a functionc call expression. This is in-line with how the `swift(>=6.0)` and `compiler(>=6.0)` directives are parsed.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2025\r\n\r\n## API-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- `MacroDefinition` used for expanding macros:\r\n  - Description: The `MacroDefinition/expansion` enum case used to have two values (`(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement])`), has now gained another value in order to support generic argument replacements in macro expansions: `(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement], genericReplacements: [GenericArgumentReplacement])`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2450\r\n  - Migration steps: Code which exhaustively checked over the enum should be changed to `case .expansion(let node, let replacements, let genericReplacements):`. Creating the `.extension` gained a compatibility shim, retaining the previous syntax source compatible (`return .expansion(node, replacements: [])`).\r\n\r\n- Effect specifiers:\r\n  - Description: The `unexpectedAfterThrowsSpecifier` node of the various effect specifiers has been removed.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2219\r\n  - Migration steps: Check `unexpectedBetweenThrowsSpecifierAndThrownError` and `unexpectedAfterThrownError` instead.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxKind` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`\r\n  - Description: `SyntaxKind` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all syntax kinds.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2292\r\n  - Migration steps: Exhaustively check all the syntax nodes that your program supports. There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `SyntaxKind`.\r\n\r\n- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`\r\n  - Description: `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all radix kinds.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2292\r\n  - Migration steps: There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix`.\r\n\r\n- `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:parseTransition:)` and `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:maximumNestingLevel:parseTransition:)`:\r\n  - Description: The default versions of `Parser.parseIncrementally` return a `IncrementalParseResult` instead of a tuple. Access to the struct should be compatible with the tuple in almost all cases unless the tuple is stored into a variable and then destructed or passed to a function that expects a tuple.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2267\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2272\r\n  - Migration steps: If necessary, change type annotations from the tuple to the `IncrementalParseResult` type.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxClassification` gained a new case: `argumentLabel`\r\n  - The new classification case covers the first names of parameters in function-like declarations and the label of arguments in function-like calls.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2375\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxClassification`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind` gained new cases: `throwsClause`\r\n  - The new cases cover the newly introduced `ThrowsClauseSyntax`\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2379\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `MacroExpansionContext` now requires a property `lexicalContext`:\r\n  - Description: The new property provides the lexical context in which the macro is expanded, and has several paired API changes. Types that conform to `MacroExpansionContext` will need to implement this property. Additionally, the `HostToPluginMessage` cases `expandFreestandingMacro` and `expandAttachedMacro` now include an optional `lexicalContext`. Finally, the `SyntaxProtocol.expand(macros:in:indentationWidth:)` syntactic expansion operation has been deprecated in favor of a new version `expand(macros:contextGenerator:indentationWidth:)` that takes a function produces a new macro expansion context for each expansion.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1554\r\n  - Migration steps: Add the new property `lexicalContext` to any `MacroExpansionContext`-conforming types. If implementing the host-to-plugin message protocol, add support for `lexicalContext`. For macro expansion operations going through `SyntaxProtocol.expand`, provide a context generator that creates a fresh context including the lexical context.\r\n\r\n- `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` in `SwiftParserDiagnostics` removed\r\n  - Description: `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` was not intended to be public API.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2531\r\n  - Migration steps: Use `if case .backslash = triviaPiece` instead\r\n\r\n- All symbols in `SwiftCompilerPluginMessageHandling` are now SPI\r\n  - Description: This module is only intended to be used from some internal components. Any other modules should not use them directly.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2489\r\n  - Migration steps: Stop using this module.\r\n",

    "body" : "## New APIs\r\n\r\n- `SameTypeRequirementSyntax` has a new `RightType` nested type.\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `SameTypeRequirementSyntax` has a new `LeftType` nested type.\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `GenericArgumentSynax` has a new `Argument` nested type.\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `GenericParameterSyntax` now has a new `specifier` property.\r\n  - Description: With the introduction of value generics, generic parameters can now be optionally preceded by either a `let` or an `each`. The `specifier` property captures the token representing which one was parsed.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2785\r\n\r\n- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax` and `FloatLiteralExprSyntax` now have a computed `representedLiteralValue` property.\r\n  - Description: Allows retrieving the represented literal value when valid.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/405\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2605\r\n    \r\n- `SyntaxProtocol` now has a method `ancestorOrSelf`.\r\n  - Description: Returns the node or the first ancestor that satisfies `condition`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2696\r\n\r\n- `Error` protocol now has an `asDiagnostics(at:)` method.\r\n  - Description: This method translates an error into one or more diagnostics, recognizing `DiagnosticsError` and `DiagnosticMessage` instances or providing its own `Diagnostic` as needed.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1816\r\n\r\n- Added a new library `SwiftIfConfig`.\r\n  - Description: This new library provides facilities for evaluating `#if` conditions and determining which regions of a syntax tree are active according to a given build configuration.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/1816\r\n  \r\n- `SwiftBasicFormat` adds a method `indented(by:)` to all syntax node types.\r\n  - Description: This method indents a node’s contents using a provided piece of `Trivia`, optionally including the first line.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2843\r\n\r\n- `Parser.ExperimentalFeatures` has a new `init?(name: String)` initializer.\r\n  - Description: This initializer returns the `Parser.ExperimentalFeatures` value that matches the experimental parser feature with the given name. The name must be spelled the same way as it is when passed to the compiler using the `-enable-experimental-feature` flag.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2895\r\n\r\n## API Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- `SyntaxProtocol.trimmed` detaches the node\r\n  - Description: Getting a trimmed version of a node detaches it from its parent. Having the trimmed node be attached to a parent was not intuitive because eg. printing the parent node would have the trimmed trivia missing, most likely forming invalid Swift code.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2689\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- `GenericParameterSyntax` deprecated `eachKeyword` in favor of `specifier`\r\n  - Description: `specifier` is now used to grab either the `each` keyword for a generic parameter or the `let` keyword.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2785\r\n\r\n- `IncrementalEdit` deprecated in favor of `SourceEdit`\r\n  - Description: `IncrementalEdit` is being dropped for `SourceEdit`. `SourceEdit` has deprecated compatibility layers to make it API-compatible with `IncrementalEdit`\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2532\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2604\r\n  \r\n- `ClosureCaptureSyntax.init(leadingTrivia:specifier:name:equal:expression:trailingComma:trailingTrivia:)` deprecated in favor of a new `ClosureCaptureSyntax.init(leadingTrivia:_:specifier:_:name:_:initializer:_:trailingComma:_:trailingTrivia:)` initializer.\r\n  - Description: `ClosureCaptureSyntax` now has an `initializer` property instead of `equal` and `expression`. Additionally, the `name` property is no longer optional.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2763 \r\n\r\n- `Indenter` in `SwiftSyntaxBuilder` has been deprecated in favor of the new `indented(by:)` in `SwiftBasicFormat`.\r\n  - Description: Indenting is really more of a formatting operation than a syntax-building operation. Additionally, the `indented(by:)` method is more intuitive to use than a `SyntaxRewriter`. Aside from `BasicFormat`, there are no other public `SyntaxRewriter` classes in the package.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2843\r\n\r\n## API-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.rightType` has changed types from `TypeSyntax` to `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.RightType`\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.leftType` has changed types from `TypeSyntax` to `SameTypeRequirementSyntax.LeftType`\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- `GenericArgumentSyntax.argument` has changed types from `TypeSyntax` to `GenericArgumentSyntax.Argument`\r\n  - Description: The Swift parser can now parse values as types in certain situations, so the new type reflects the possibility of the argument being either an `ExprSyntax` or a `TypeSyntax`.\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2859\r\n\r\n- Moved `Radix` and `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.radix` from `SwiftRefactor` to `SwiftSyntax`.\r\n  - Description: Allows retrieving the radix value from the `literal.text`.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/405\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2605\r\n\r\n- `FixIt.Change` gained a new case `replaceChild(data:)`.\r\n  - Description: The new case covers the replacement of a child node with another node.\r\n  - Issue: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues/2205\r\n  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2758\r\n  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `FixIt.Change`, cover the new case.\r\n\r\n- `ClosureCaptureSyntax.name` is no longer optional.\r\n  - Description: Due to the new `ClosureCaptureSyntax` node structure, `name` property is non-optional.\r\n  - Pull request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2763 \r\n",
